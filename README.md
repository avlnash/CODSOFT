TASK 1: Movie Genre Classification

Movie Genre Classification is a machine learning project that aims to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, this project provides an automated way to categorize movies into genres such as Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, etc.

Key Components:

Data Collection: The dataset consists of movie plot summaries paired with their corresponding genres. It is sourced from popular databases such as IMDb or TMDB.

Data Preprocessing: Textual data is cleaned and preprocessed, including tasks like removing stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization. Categorical data is converted into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.

Feature Engineering: Features are extracted from plot summaries to represent the textual data in a numerical format. This includes using TF-IDF vectorization or word embeddings to capture semantic meanings.

Model Building: Several classification models are applied to predict movie genres:

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model that works well for text classification tasks.
Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary or multi-class classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that finds the optimal hyperplane for classification tasks.

Neural Networks: Advanced models such as LSTM, GRU, or transformer-based models like BERT can be used for capturing contextual information.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix helps to understand misclassifications.

Deployment: The trained model is saved and can be deployed via a web service or integrated into an application to provide genre predictions for new movies based on their plot summaries.


TASK 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning:

Overview:
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project uses various machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, helping to prevent financial losses due to fraud.

Dataset:
The project utilizes the fraudTrain.csv and fraudTest.csv datasets, which contain anonymized credit card transaction data, including features such as transaction amount, location, and merchant details. The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

Project Structure:
fraudTrain.csv: Training dataset containing transaction details.
fraudTest.csv: Testing dataset for evaluating model performance.
credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the best model.
credit_card_fraud_model.pkl: Serialized model file for making predictions on new data.

TASK 3: Customer Churn Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a customer will exit or remain with a company based on various features. Using the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset, which contains customer demographics and account information, this project applies several classification models to identify patterns and predict customer churn.

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and converting categorical features into numerical format. Data is scaled to standardize feature values.

Model Building: 

Three classification models are implemented:

Logistic Regression: A basic linear model for binary classification.

Random Forest: An ensemble model that improves classification accuracy through multiple decision trees.

Gradient Boosting: An advanced ensemble method that builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models.

Model Evaluation: Each model's performance is assessed using accuracy and detailed classification reports to evaluate precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Saving: The best-performing model (Gradient Boosting) is saved using joblib and made available for download or storage on Google Drive.

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning for customer retention strategies and provides a foundation for further experimentation with different algorithms or feature engineering techniques.
